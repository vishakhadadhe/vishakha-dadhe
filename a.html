Gujaratis live in Gujarat, one of the western states in India.
The name comes from "Gujara," a branch of the White Huns.
This group ruled the area during the eighth and ninth centuries.
Gujara also is the name of a pastoral caste (social class).
Archaeological evidence shows the region had cities as early as 2000 BC .
Muslims conquered Gujarat in the thirteenth century AD and ruled for the next
450 years.
Control passed to the British East India Company in 1818.

After India's independence in 1947, Gujarat was incorporated into Bombay
state.
In 1960, the Gujarati-speaking areas of Bombay were split off to form the
present-day Gujarat.
